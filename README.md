# TriviaGame üåÑ

In this game, user will go through a series of 10 multiple choice questions about different places in the world. They will have 30 seconds to answer each question. Once answered they will be taken to a page that tells them whether they are correct or incorrect and it will show the correct answer and a photo corresponding to it. If they run out of time they will be notified the time is up and it will still take them to the page giving the correct answer and photo. At the end of the 10 questions they will see a total score of correct, incorrect and unanswered questions.
